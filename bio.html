		<h1>Hey, My Name Is Chelsea!</h1>
		<p>
			I am a Graphic and Web Designer, fresh out on the market for employment. I stumbled upon
			my interest in Web Design through the Graphic Design BFA program at the Art Institute, and now I'm hooked!
			I have a natural relationship with the visual world, and I greatly enjoy learning more about Web Development.
		</p>
		<p>
			My relationship with art began at a young age, and has been encouraged by friends and family throughout my whole life.
			I love telling stories with doodles, so it seemed obvious that I would go to school to find a way to better market my
			talents. I never expected to love something as intimidating as code and Web Development. Once it was broken down for me,
			I found the challenge encouraging. It exercises a part of my brain, and it allows me to problem solve. I love puzzles!
		</p>
		<p>
			Along with puzzles, I enjoy video games, board games, comic book, cult movies, and cartoons!
			Thankfully, my son seems to enjoy these things too. Ultimately my goal is to find work doing something I enjoy, that challenges
			me and pushes me to learn more. I want to pursue a career that gives me time to be with my kid, and provide him with a stable
			home. Pretty reasonable, don't you think?
